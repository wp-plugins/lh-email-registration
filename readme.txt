Streamlines user registration in the back end by allowing administrators to remove redundant fields and replaces usernames with email addresses

== Description ==

This plugin allows the following you to configure the backend new user screen to incorporate the following features

* Optional use of email addresses only instead of username and email.
* Optionally hide the new user url field
* Optionally allow you to specify whether an email should be sent to each new user or not

These changes make adding new users to WordPress a lot faster.

One word of caution is that IF YOU USE EMAL ADDRESSES ONLly the plugin replaces the username with the email address of the user when a user is saved in the database. meaning your users will no longer have a separate username.
